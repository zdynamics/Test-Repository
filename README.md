## Features

You can do multiple tasks with this repository, such as plot your measurements/trends/signals and this allows you to see what's happening with your system. **The logic/theory used to develop this repository is based on the following literature**:

- Book 1[^1]
- Book 2[^thesis]
- Paper 1[^research]
- Paper 2
- [Webpage 1](https://zdynamics.org/ "The Future is Robotics")
- Webpage 2

## Repository Content

This repository includes the following functionalities:

1. Functionality 1: Here is a brief description of what can be done with this
2. Functionality 2: Here is a brief description of what can be done with this
3. ~~Functionality 3~~: Here is a brief description of what can be done with this

You can also list this functionalities using a table:

| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
|**Function 1**| Description 1 | *Problem 1* |
|**Function 2**| Description 2 | *Problem 2* |
|**~~Function 3~~**| Description 3 | *Problem 3* |

If you're developing a repository with code (such a Python library), you can use the code block as follows:
```python
print("Hello world! This is my first code block with Markdown")
```

Also, you can include an in-line code block ```as this``` if you want to describe something in the same line of text
